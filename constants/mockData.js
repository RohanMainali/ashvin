"Low" urgency usually means no immediate concern, but always discuss any results with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.',

Its primary function is to ensure blood flows in one direction, from the left atrium to the left ventricle, and prevents backflow when the ventricle contracts. Problems with this valve can lead to conditions like mitral regurgitation or stenosis.",
